    "description": "The plank is an isometric core strength exercise that involves maintaining a difficult position for extended periods of time. The most common plank is the front plank which is held in a push-up position with the body's weight borne on forearms, elbows, and toes. The plank strengthens the abdominals, back, and shoulders.",
    "focuses": [
        "Keep the elbows under the shoulders (or you can do a plank on your hands)",
        "Rise onto your toes, feet are just outside of hip-width",
        "Pull your abdominals into the spine-keep them locked there",
        "Squeeze the glutes",
        "Add any harder options such as toe tapping in and out, pulsing back and forth, lifting lefs or arms OR make it easier by dropping to the knees"

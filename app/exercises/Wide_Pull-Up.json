        "Grab the pull-up bar with the palms facing forward using a wide grip",
        "As you have both arms extended in front of you holding the bar, bring your torso forward and head so that there is an imaginary line from the pull-up bar to the back of your neck. This is your starting position.",
        "Pull your torso up until the bar is near the back of your neck. Exhale as you perform this portion of the movement. The upper torso should remain stationary as it moves through space and only the arms should move. The forwarms should do no other work other than hold the bar.",
        "After a second on the contracted position, start to inhale and slowly lower your torso back to the starting position when your arms are fully extended and the lats are fully stretched",
        "Repeat this motion for the prescribed amount of repititions"

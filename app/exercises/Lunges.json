    "description": "A lunge can refer to any position of the human body where one leg is positioned forward with knee bent and foot flat on the ground while the other lef is positioned behind. It is used by athletes in cross-training for sports, by weight-trainers as a fitness exercise. Lunges are a good exercise for strengthening, sculpting and building several muscles/muscle groups, including the quadriceps as well as the hamstrings.",

    "description": "The Chin-Up is a strength training exercise. People frequently do this exercise with the intention of strengthening muscles such as the latissimus dorsi and biceps, which extend the shoulder and flex the elbow. It is a form of a Pull-Up in which the range of motion is established in relation to a person's chin. Both Pull-Ups and Chin-Ups are two of the best exercises for back and overall upper body conditioning however they target the muscles a bit differently.",

        "Grab the Chin-Up bar with the palms facing your torso and a grip close than the shoulder width.",
        "As you have both arms extended in front of you holding the bar at the chosen grip width, keep your torso as straight as possible while creating a curvature on your lower back and sticking your chest out. This is your starting position.",
        "As you breathe out, pull your torso up until your head is around the level of the pull-up bar. Concentrate on using the biceps muscles in order to perform the movement. Keep the elbows close to your body.",
        "After a second of squeezing the biceps in the contracted position, slowly lower your torso back to the starting position; when your arms are fully extended. Breathe in as you perform this portion of the movement.",
        "Repeat this motion for the prescribed amount of repetitions."

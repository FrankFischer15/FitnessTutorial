        "Get into push-up position, with your body straight, toes on the floor, and hands on the floor slightly wider than shoulder width apart with arms fully extended",
        "Keeping your shoulders square to the floor, and your left arm above your shoulder and rest your right hand near your waist side",
        "Inhale as you lower your body towards the ground by bending at the elbows",
        "Exhale as you push your body back up, than switch your hand placement, so your right hand is now over your shoulder and left hand by your waist side",

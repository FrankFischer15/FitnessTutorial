    "description": "The pull up is perhaps the best exercise you can do if you want to build a strong, lean upper body. All you need is a bar that will support your weight. The pull ups is known as a back exercise for good reason. Your lats and traps are heavily involved in the pull up movement. They are the most visible muscles in your back. Improving your pull ups is a great way to build a powerful looking back. ",
